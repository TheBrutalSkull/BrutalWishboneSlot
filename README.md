# Description

I think a lot of people did that kind of mod, but I just didn't find any that was doing that AND use AzuExtendedInventory slot API to do it.
Well, there we go... I did it for my friends and I first, but then I thought it could maybe be useful for other.

## Mod Description

This mod is basically just a slot for the Wishbone, because I hate having to switch between the strength belt and the wishbone everytimes when I'm mining silver, or just exploring for treasures.

This mod does exactly what I wanted it to do : Add a new slot using the EPI so I can stop switching my items.

There's no config for now since I don't think it's necessary.

This mod is hardly depending on AzuExtendedInventory since I use that mod everytimes and if you're not, I don't understand your choices haha!

Anyways, I'm on the Odin discord server. You can tag me there if you find anything.
